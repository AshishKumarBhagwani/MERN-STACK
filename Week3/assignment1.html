        <p>Our name is <a href="#">Gingerbread Marketing</a> and we tell stories. It's sort of a passion. See a story is an extension of who you are and is the most powerful weapon which you can
        use to change the world. We want to help <b>Coaches</b> change the world. So we have worked hard towards that goal and helped numerous top coaches tell their stories to increase leads, clients and revenue. From industries spending from fitness, life, mindset, relationship, peak performance and bussiness.-<b>Gingerbread</b>
        is about spreading your <q>why</q> in a way that allows people to become connected with you and attain their greatest versions of themselves. We believe your story is the best delivered via email.</p>
        <p>Sharing your VISION, you WHY and your PASSION as a coach, is our mission. When you can teach someone to grow themselves you're allowing them to bring happiness and positive impact to all the lives they touch and encounter. And so our <b>Email Marketing Autoresponder Framework Course</b> is here to help you create that type of impact. By the way ...WHat we teach..we first put to test... On ourselves.</p>
        <p>We have been so blessed since launching. <b>Gingerbread Marketing</b> literally went from $25 in startup capital to grossing over $40k+ in less than 2 months of launching (now that a story)-- without ever having to borrow money or take investment. We did this by relentlessly focussing on our <b><q>WHY</q></b> and helping coaches achieve theirs. Something that many email marketers forget-- Putting <b>Gingerbread</b> on track to becoming the #1 email marketing storytelling company in the world for Top Coaches.</p>
